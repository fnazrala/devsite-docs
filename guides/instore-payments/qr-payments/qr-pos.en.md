# QR Payments in Point of Sale

## Flow

![QR POS Flow](/images/mobile/qr-user-flow.en.svg)

## Concepts

First, you must familiarize yourself with the following concepts since you will use them during the integration.

| Attribute      | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | It is the [access token](https://www.mercadopago.com/mlm/account/credentials) of the Mercado Pago account to which the charges will be credited. |
| `COLLECTOR_ID` | It is the user number of the Mercado Pago account, it is the last 9 digits of your `access_token`, after the middle script. |

## Objects

In addition to the previous concepts, you must also know the objects with which we will work.

### POS Object

```json
{
    "name":"Principal POS", 
    "fixed_amount": true,
    "category": 621102,
    "store_id": "123456",
    "external_id": "4lph4num3r1c"
}
```

**Definitions**

- `name`: Descriptive name. It is a String of up to 45 characters.
- `external_id`: It is the unique identifier of the point of sale. It is an alphanumeric code defined by you, it can not contain spaces or special characters and uppercase letters are not case sensitive. It is a String of up to 40 characters.
- `category` : MCC code that indicates the point of sale item. The possible values are:
  - Gastronomy (Argentina): 621102
  - General: `null`
- `store_id`: It is an identifier number of the branch to which the point of sale belongs. The id of the Store.
- `fixed_amount`: Indicates if the user can enter any amount when reading the QR or will have to wait for an order to be available. It is a boolean.

### Order Object

```json
{
    "external_reference": "internal reference id",
	"notification_url": "www.yourserver.com/endpoint",
      "items" :[{
        "title" : "Tacos",
        "currency_id" : "MXN",
        "unit_price" : 16.0,
        "quantity" : 4
      },{
        "title" : "Soda",
        "currency_id" : "MXN",
        "unit_price" : 15.0,
        "quantity" : 1
      }]
}
```

**Definitions**

    "status": "approved",
    "status_detail": "accredited",
    ...

Consult the [full documentation](https://www.mercadopago.com.mx/developers/en/reference/payments/resource/) about this object in our API Reference.

## Payments

### Create QR

You must create a QR code for each POS with an `external_id` that identifies it.

**API QR**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mercadopago.com/pos?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN -d
'{
    "name":"Principal POS", 
    "fixed_amount": true,
    "category": 621102,
    "store_id": "123456",
    "external_id": "4lph4num3r1c"
}'
```

### Order Creation

To create a payment through a QR code you must create an order with the detail of the pending payment.

**API Orders**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mercadopago.com/mpmobile/instore/qr/COLLECTOR_ID/EXTERNAL_ID?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN -d
'{
    "external_reference": "internal id",
	"notification_url": "www.yourserver.com/endpoint",
      "items" :[{
        "title" : "Tacos",
        "currency_id" : "MXN",
        "unit_price" : 16.0,
        "quantity" : 4
      }]
}'
```

The order expires 10 minutes after being created and automatically when paid. If a different expiration time is desired, you can send the header `X-Ttl-Store-Preference` with the desired time in seconds.

For example, if you want it to be available for 5 minutes you should send the header '' X-Ttl-Store-Preference: 300'`. Keep in mind that if a person pays that order before the set time, it will expire.

### Get payment

After the user makes the payment you can obtain the data using any of the following ways:

1. [IPN](https://www.mercadopago.com.mx/developers/es/guides/notifications/ipn/): When the payment is created, we send a notification via webhook to the URL configured in the `notification_url` of the order, you will need to be subscribed to merchant_order's type notifications.
2. Do the [payment search](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/reference/payments/_payments_search/get/) using the `external_reference` as the search criteria.

### Delete order

If you want to delete the order associated with a QR before the time expires (`X-Ttl-Store-Preference`) or be paid.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.mercadopago.com/mpmobile/instore/qr/COLLECTOR_ID/EXTERNAL_ID?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Refunds

There will be times when you will need to do a partial or total [refund](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/manage-account/cancellations-and-refunds/).

**Total refund**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/payments/PAYMENT_ID/refunds?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Parcial refund**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/payments/PAYMENT_ID/refunds?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN -d '{ "amount": 10.50 }'
```

## Testing

Two test users must be created: one buyer and another collector. With the billing user, the QR must be created and with the other, enter the Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre apps.

Consult the [test data](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/es/guides/payments/web-checkout/testing): test users and test cards that can be used.

| Test cases                                                   | Expected response                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The user scans a valid QR code before placing the order.     | The app does not display an order.                           |
| The user scans a QR code with invalid parameters, meaning that it refers to a nonexistent account. | The app reports that an error has occurred.                  |
| The user scans a valid code, once the order has been placed and the sales order has been created. | La app muestra la orden.                                     |
| The user generates an approved payment.                      | The POS system receives the information of an approved payment. |
| The user generates an rejected payment.                      | The POS system receives the information of an rejected payment. |
| A return of a payment is made from the POS.                  | The return is impacted in the buyer's account.               |
